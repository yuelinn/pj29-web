The Importance of Agriculture
food security (increase of demand)
incl price
social unrest?

### wheat as an important crop


## Agriculture: the Past
expanding land use, massively increasing inputs – irrigation, 
fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides, greenhouses, 
high-energy feed and pharmacological 
supplements for livestock, massive deployment of 
heavy machinery – and by relying on tried and 
trusted farming methods to maximise productivity.


wastage in agriculture: loss throughout the agriculture process

third agricultural revolution aka the green revolution


## The Agriculture Industry: Current State of Affairs

three main misions: 
increase yield
sustainably
low cost/ affordable

objectives:
better resource management 



Current Challenges
condition changes due to climate change
Industrialisation
polution? haze/bush fires
“Four different crops provide 60 per cent of our calories – wheat, rice, maize and potatoes. That increases our vulnerability,” https://www.foodandlandusecoalition.org/global-report/

Current Solutions
Technical Solutions:
Established existing methods:
Monitoring:

to inc wheat production
pest resilience
automation of growth monitoring during testing 
Sensors (with large range of wavelength) + computer vision —> for produce monitoring, process automation
crop monitoring:
for selection of plants for propagation (phenotyping)
seed production/ phenotyping
automated fruit harvesting
challenges: delicate fruits, prime ripeness, (locating fruits)

sorting produce:
reduce crop wastage (can easily check each item, no need to throw whole crop)
monitoring livestock:
NPL: checking fat/muscle ratio of pigs to feed sufficiently and id readiness for slaughtering
IoT Smart Farms
[A Review of IoT based Smart Farm Monitoring]

Reducing climate impacts:
product lifetime? (impact of manufacturing used products?)
reducing green house gases emissions
mercury levels?

Safe food
dark waters


Challenges:
Training in lab vs in wild (scale of data required to compensate for varying light sources) — big data for machine learning
Human-robot interaction


government/industrial efforts:
specifically in Malaysia,
specifically in Singapore
efforts in Europe
efforts in UK
New Agriculture Bill to focus on subsidies for sustainable practices. Also monitors food security
efforts in US
efforts in Australia
efforts in NZ
Costa Rica: government subsidies successfully reduced deforestation due to agriculture


food to compost?
